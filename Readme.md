A hardware- software-based codesign that implements lightweight training for self-attention mechanisms on various spatiotemporal datasets and
accelerates it using heterogeneous architecture. Our parameter-efficient training approach incorporates intrinsic dimensionality
to reduce the trainable parameters, achieving efficiency in training without significant loss in accuracy.
